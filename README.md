# ImmersiveAudioVR :+1:
The NYU Immersive Audio group is constantly developing and testing new VR reality tools and experiences designed primarily in, but not limited to, [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) and [Max](https://cycling74.com/). A number of researchers including PhD student Andrea Genovese, Master student Greg Reardon and recently graduated Masters students like Simon Calle, have developed these tools and experiences in conjunction with faculty and would now like to share them with the community. We hence present this repository of tools and templates for the production, manipulation and reproduction of virtual reality experiences with a focus on immersive audio.

<!-- Look, a list!

 * foo
 * bar
 * baz -->
<!-- And here's some code!

```javascript
$(function(){
  $('div').html('I am a div.');
});
``` -->
